      <h3>Passion</h3>
      <p>
        I will say my major drive to programming was built on my keen fascination for video games.  I love video games and game development is an area I really 
         want to venture into later on in my career. I'm excited about the chance to work as a programmer, 
         and I believe my skills and enthusiasm align well with the challenges and opportunities this role offers.

      <h3>Money</h3>
      <p> The pursuit of financial stability and success is a powerful motivating factor, and there should be no hesitation in acknowledging that monetary rewards play a significant role in driving one's aspirations.
         It's important to recognize that alongside personal fulfillment and passion, financial considerations are an integral part of one's career journey, 
         contributing to overall well-being and providing the means to achieve both personal and professional goals.</p>
